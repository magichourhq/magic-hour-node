  /**
   * Generate asset upload urls
   *
   * Generates a list of pre-signed upload URLs for the assets required. This API is only necessary if you want to upload to Magic Hour's storage. Refer to the [Input Files Guide](/integration/input-files) for more details.
   *
   * The response array will match the order of items in the request body.
   *
   * **Valid file extensions per asset type**:
   * - video: mp4, m4v, mov, webm
   * - audio: mp3, mpeg, wav, aac, aiff, flac
   * - image: png, jpg, jpeg, webp, avif, jp2, tiff, bmp
   *
   * > Note: `gif` is only supported for face swap API `video_file_path` field.
   *
   * Once you receive an upload URL, send a `PUT` request to upload the file directly.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * ```
   * curl -X PUT --data '@/path/to/file/video.mp4' \
   *   https://videos.magichour.ai/api-assets/id/video.mp4?<auth params from the API response>
   * ```
   *
   *
   * POST /v1/files/upload-urls
