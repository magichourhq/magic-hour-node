### Face Swap Photo Generate Workflow <a name="generate"></a>

The workflow performs the following action

1. upload local assets to Magic Hour storage. So you can pass in a local path instead of having to upload files yourself
2. trigger a generation
3. poll for a completion status. This is configurable
4. if success, download the output to local directory

> [!TIP]
> This is the recommended way to use the SDK unless you have specific needs where it is necessary to split up the actions.

#### Parameters

In addition to the parameters listed in the `create` section below, `generate` introduces 3 new parameters:

- `waitForCompletion` (boolean, default true): Whether to wait for the project to complete.
- `downloadOutputs` (boolean, default true): Whether to download the generated files
- `downloadDirectory` (string, optional): Directory to save downloaded files (defaults to current directory)

#### Example Snippet

```typescript
import Client from "magic-hour";

const client = new Client({ token: process.env["API_TOKEN"]!! });
const res = await client.v1.faceSwapPhoto.generate(
  {
    assets: {
      faceMappings: [
        {
          newFace: "api-assets/id/1234.png",
          originalFace: "api-assets/id/0-0.png",
        },
      ],
      faceSwapMode: "all-faces",
      sourceFilePath: "/path/to/1234.png",
      targetFilePath: "/path/to/1234.png",
    },
    name: "Face Swap image",
  },
  {
    waitForCompletion: true,
    downloadOutputs: true,
    downloadDirectory: "outputs",
  },
);

```
